Reflection

What did you learn from reading and commenting on this code?**  
I learned how higher-order functions like `map`, `filter`, and `reduce` can simplify tasks like summing totals, filtering entries, or finding unique values in an array. Commenting each line helped me better understand how the logic flows and how each function works step by step.

What was the most confusing part?**  
At first, I wasnâ€™t totally sure how the `new Set()` part in `uniqueHobbies` worked, but after breaking it down, I saw how it removes duplicates. It also helped me understand how useful the spread operator is for converting sets back into arrays.
